# **AcademiaDrive - University Notes Sharing Platform**

Welcome to **AcademiaDrive**, a platform designed to solve the problem of accessing and sharing study materials within your university or college. If your university doesn't provide easy access to study materials, or if you just want to make your own notes available to others, **AcademiaDrive** is the solution.

The platform takes your existing Google Drive-based file-sharing system and upgrades it to a **GitHub Pages**-hosted website, making it more user-friendly and easily accessible for everyone in your college or university.

### **How It Works:**

**AcademiaDrive** allows you to create, upload, and share your notes in a simple, clean way. All you need to do is create a folder structure inside the **public** folder, upload your notes, and the website automatically reflects the changes.

### 3. **Upload Your Notes:**

* Inside the **public** folder, create folders to organize your notes however you like. It can be by course, subject, or even by specific topics.
* You can add any kind of study material, such as PDF files, notes, slides, videos, and more.
* Example structure:

  ```
  public/
  ├── Math101/
  │   └── Math_Notes.pdf
  ├── CS201/
  │   └── CS_Slides.pdf
  ├── Physics/
  │   └── Physics_Notes.pdf
  ├── Videos/
  │   └── Lecture1.mp4
  ```

### 4. **Commit Your Changes:**

Once you've added your notes, commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added Math101 and CS201 notes"
git push origin main
```

### 5. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**

* After pushing your changes, go to the **Pull Requests** tab and create a **New Pull Request** to merge your changes into the main repository. This will make your notes available to everyone in your university or college.

### 6. **Accessing Notes:**

* After your changes are merged, the newly added notes will be accessible through the website hosted on GitHub Pages.
* Students can browse the folders by course, subject, or topic and download the materials they need.
